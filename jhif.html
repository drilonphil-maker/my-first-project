     <h1>MY NAME IS KYLE SALUDAR</h1>
     <hr>
     <p>I like gays because they are some of the most genuine and accepting people I know. They express themselves freely and confidently, and that inspires me to be true to who I am. Many gay people show strength every day by simply choosing to live openly despite judgment or misunderstanding from others. Their courage motivates me to become more open-minded and compassionate.

Liking gays also means supporting equality. Everyone deserves to be respected no matter who they love. When we accept people for who they are, we help build a kinder and more inclusive world. I believe that friendships and connections become stronger when we remove stereotypes and learn to appreciate people for their personality, kindness, and actions.

Overall, I like gays because they remind us that love, respect, and individuality are what truly matter. Accepting them is a way of celebrating diversity and choosing kindness in a world that needs it.</p>
